There are areas that the **web** cannot replace and that should stay that way. Cloud operating systems, although we would like them to become a thing of the future, are not for the immediate future. The user needs ownership of his computer and the software that makes it work.

Same goes for desktop applications where access to the Internet is not available, for applications that need to take advantage of the hardware at the highest level to squeeze all the necessary performance, for precision applications where the added factor of an outside connection simply creates one more point of failure.

For all the rest, **the web is a viable and desirable solution**, because of the added benefits. You obtain an application that is easy to update for all the users, irrespective of their underlying operating system, you get access to data from anywhere on multiple types of devices, you get good customer service, safety of data because best practices can be implemented at central level, you get unitary user experience for the application interaction. 

The downsides of the central model system are just as big, if improperly used. Data centralization without good privacy and without proper security can lead to proportionally bigger disasters compared to the distributed approach. 

This is why at WhiteCityCode we always employ the best practices in the field. It is important that when you create applications for the web you leave that in the hands of professionals.
